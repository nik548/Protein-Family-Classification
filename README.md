# Protein-Family-Classification
Abstract:
Protein classification is a huge area of study in bioinformatics and computational biomedical engineering. Knowing the family of a protein makes it much easier to predict its classification. Predicting protein classification is vital in the life sciences for the study of new diseases, drug development and biomaterials. In recent years, unsupervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool to help solve previously difficult problems involving large and complex datasets. We developed a novel deep learning algorithm which can classify proteins by family using only their sequences. By applying natural language processing to the sequences in order to represent them as numerical vectors, we were able to utilize a convolutional neural network in order to successfully classify 750 different protein families using over one million training examples from the pfam database. This model was able to achieve an accuracy score of 99.8 percent. This model can be used to reliably and efficiently predict the family of unknown protein sequences.
